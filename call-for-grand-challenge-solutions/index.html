            <h1>Call for Grand Challenge Solutions</h1>
            <p align="justify">The DEBS Grand Challenge is a series of competitions that started in 2010, in which both participants from academia and industry compete with the goal of building faster and more scalable distributed and event-based systems that solve a practical problem. Every year, the DEBS Grand Challenge participants have a chance to explore a new data set and a new problem and can compare their results based on common evaluation criteria. The winners of the challenge are announced during the conference where they are competing for a performance and an audience award. Apart from correctness and performance, submitted solutions are also judged along a set of non-functional requirements to assess their practicability.</p>
			
			<p>The 2022 DEBS Grand Challenge focuses on real-time complex event processing of real-world high-volume tick data provided by Infront Financial Technology. In the data set, about 5000+ financial instruments are being traded on three major exchanges over the course of a week. The goal of the challenge is to efficiently compute specific trend indicators and detect patterns resembling those used by real-life traders to decide on buying or selling on the financial markets.</p>
			
			<p>Further details on the data set provided, the queries, non-functional requirements and the overall submission process can be found here: <a href="https://2022.debs.org/call-for-grand-challenge-solutions/">https://2022.debs.org/call-for-grand-challenge-solutions/</a>.</p>

            <h1>Topic</h1>
            <p align="justify">The outbreak of COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) has disrupted the world. In March, significant parts of the world came to a standstill when governments announced their lockdown. This lockdown had multidimensional effects, and it affected everyone and everything differently. One rather surprising effect of the lockdown is that it improved the air quality due to reduced mobility and traffic. Air Quality Index (AQI) was detected to be improved throughout the world [1][2] during the lockdown. In this year’s Grand Challenge, we will use a air quality dataset to find which areas improved the most in terms of AQI index compared to the average AQI of the previous year.</p>

            <h1>Participation</h1>
            <p align="justify">Participation in the DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge consists of three steps: (1) registration, (2) iterative solution submission, and (3) paper submission. The first step is to pre-register your submission by 
		     registering at your abstract at the EasyChair conference management system  (<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=debs2022">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=debs2022</a>) in the "Grand Challenge Track" and send an e-mail to one of the Grand Challenge Co-Chairs (see <a href="https://2022.debs.org/organizing-committee/">https://2022.debs.org/organizing-committee/</a>). Solutions to the challenge, once developed, must be submitted to the evaluation platform in order to get it benchmarked in the challenge. The evaluation platform provides detailed feedback on performance and allows to update the solution in an iterative process. A solution can be continuously improved until the challenge closing date. Evaluation results of the last submitted solution will be used for the final performance ranking. The last step is to upload a short paper (minimum 2 pages, maximum 6 pages) describing the final solution to the EasyChair system (a link will be provided at a later point in time). All papers will be reviewed by the DEBS Grand Challenge Committee to assess the merit and originality of submitted solutions. All solutions of sufficient quality will be presented during the poster session at the DEBS 2022 conference.</p>

  biography: Prof. Dimitrios Georgakopoulos is the Director of Swinburne University of Technology’s Key IoT Lab and Industry 4.0 Program Leader. Before that he was Research Director at CSIRO’s ICT Centre and Professor at RMIT. Dimitrios has also held research and management positions in several industrial labs in the USA, including Telcordia Technologies (where he helped found Telcordia’s research laboratories in Austin, Texas and Poznan, Poland), Microelectronics and Computer Corporation, GTE (now Verizon) Laboratories, and Bell Communications Research. Dimitrios has authored 200 articles, and his publications have received approximately 20,000 citations. He is ranked by Microsoft Academic as one of the Top Authors in the fields of the Internet of Things (2013-2022), Context Awareness (1990-2021), Middleware (1990-2021), and Workflow (1993-2002). According to Elsevier’s Science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators (August 2021 data update), I am in the 2% of top-cited authors (top 1%, if self-citations are not considered). He has led major multidisciplinary research initiatives in digital manufacturing, precision agriculture, human services, water management, and defense; won more than twenty research awards; and attracted significant personal research funding ($60.5M+) from both industry and government in the USA, EU, and Australia.

  title: It’s funny because it’s true - confronting scientific catechisms
  affiliation_img: /img/keynotes/falaah.jpg
  abstract: Meet AI - It’s a very strange time in its life. We have a tremendous amount of data at our disposal and a tremendous potential to do good, immense interest to build and widely deploy these systems and a very real impact (including irrevocable harm) associated with this technology. The landscape is rife with problems – incentive structures and gold-rush mentality in scholarship, celebrity culture and media hype, unhealthy extremes of techno-bashing and techno-optimism and the false dichotomy between “social problems” and “engineering problems”. Nuance and critical thinking are the most valuable, yet scarce commodities! A possible first step at self-correction could be for us – as practitioners and designers of these systems – to stop taking *ourselves* so seriously and instead direct this gravitas onto the *consequences* of our work (beyond citation counts and academic accolades). How, you ask? Using the marvelous world of comics! In this talk, I’ll present my thoughts (in comic form) on some of the pressing problems in the AI landscape (broadly defined) and attempt to motivate artistic interventions as a possible solution to catechisms of the scientific landscape that we take too seriously and perhaps need to rethink. A running theme through the talk will be the need to include diverse voices and methodologies, and to define the scope of impact more broadly — what difference does any of our work make if we can’t communicate it to the people that matter? 
    
  biography: Falaah is a first year Data Science PhD student at NYU, working with Prof Julia Stoyanovich on the ‘fairness’ and ‘robustness’ of algorithmic systems. An engineer by training and an artist by nature, Falaah creates scientific comic books to bridge together scholarship from different disciplines, and to disseminate the nuances of her research in a way that is more accessible to the general public — She runs the ‘Data, Responsibly’ and ‘We are AI’ comic series with Prof Julia Stoyanovich at NYU’s Center for Responsible AI, and the ‘Superheroes of Deep Learning’ comic series with Prof Zack Lipton (CMU). Falaah holds an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (with a minor in Mathematics) from Shiv Nadar University, India, and has industry experience in building machine learning models for access management and security at Dell EMC.

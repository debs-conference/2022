  abstract: "In this talk, I will present RisingWave, a distributed SQL streaming database designed for the cloud. RisingWave provides standard SQL as the interactive interface. It speaks in PostgreSQL dialect, and can be seamlessly integrated with the PostgreSQL ecosystem with no code change. RisingWave treats streams as tables and allows users to compose complex queries over streaming and historical data declaratively. RisingWave is designed for the cloud. The cloud-native architecture enables RisingWave to scale compute and storage resources separately and infinitely based on the users’ demands. We open-sourced RisingWave kernel under Apache License 2.0. Together with the open community, we are on the mission to democratize stream processing: to make stream processing simple, affordable, and accessible for everyone."

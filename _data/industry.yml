  biography: Prof. Dimitrios Georgakopoulos is the Director of Swinburne University of Technology’s Key IoT Lab and Industry 4.0 Program Leader. Before that he was Research Director at CSIRO’s ICT Centre and Professor at RMIT. Dimitrios has also held research and management positions in several industrial labs in the USA, including Telcordia Technologies (where he helped found Telcordia’s research laboratories in Austin, Texas and Poznan, Poland), Microelectronics and Computer Corporation, GTE (now Verizon) Laboratories, and Bell Communications Research. Dimitrios has authored 200 articles, and his publications have received approximately 20,000 citations. He is ranked by Microsoft Academic as one of the Top Authors in the fields of the Internet of Things (2013-2022), Context Awareness (1990-2021), Middleware (1990-2021), and Workflow (1993-2002). According to Elsevier’s Science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators (August 2021 data update), I am in the 2% of top-cited authors (top 1%, if self-citations are not considered). He has led major multidisciplinary research initiatives in digital manufacturing, precision agriculture, human services, water management, and defense; won more than twenty research awards; and attracted significant personal research funding ($60.5M+) from both industry and government in the USA, EU, and Australia.

  title: It’s funny because it’s true - confronting scientific catechisms
  affiliation_img: /img/keynotes/falaah.jpg
  abstract: Meet AI - It’s a very strange time in its life. We have a tremendous amount of data at our disposal and a tremendous potential to do good, immense interest to build and widely deploy these systems and a very real impact (including irrevocable harm) associated with this technology. The landscape is rife with problems – incentive structures and gold-rush mentality in scholarship, celebrity culture and media hype, unhealthy extremes of techno-bashing and techno-optimism and the false dichotomy between “social problems” and “engineering problems”. Nuance and critical thinking are the most valuable, yet scarce commodities! A possible first step at self-correction could be for us – as practitioners and designers of these systems – to stop taking *ourselves* so seriously and instead direct this gravitas onto the *consequences* of our work (beyond citation counts and academic accolades). How, you ask? Using the marvelous world of comics! In this talk, I’ll present my thoughts (in comic form) on some of the pressing problems in the AI landscape (broadly defined) and attempt to motivate artistic interventions as a possible solution to catechisms of the scientific landscape that we take too seriously and perhaps need to rethink. A running theme through the talk will be the need to include diverse voices and methodologies, and to define the scope of impact more broadly — what difference does any of our work make if we can’t communicate it to the people that matter? 
    
  biography: Falaah is a first year Data Science PhD student at NYU, working with Prof Julia Stoyanovich on the ‘fairness’ and ‘robustness’ of algorithmic systems. An engineer by training and an artist by nature, Falaah creates scientific comic books to bridge together scholarship from different disciplines, and to disseminate the nuances of her research in a way that is more accessible to the general public — She runs the ‘Data, Responsibly’ and ‘We are AI’ comic series with Prof Julia Stoyanovich at NYU’s Center for Responsible AI, and the ‘Superheroes of Deep Learning’ comic series with Prof Zack Lipton (CMU). Falaah holds an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (with a minor in Mathematics) from Shiv Nadar University, India, and has industry experience in building machine learning models for access management and security at Dell EMC.

  title: "Climate Change and Computing: Facts, Perspectives and an Open Discussion"
  affiliation_img: /img/keynotes/amarilli.jpg
  abstract: "The rise of temperatures on Earth have alerted communities around the globe to devise immediate solutions to help curb the severe effects of Climate Change, which is attributed to greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities. Even though the Computing field is a cause of emissions in its own right, it also has the potential to increase the efficiency of human workflows in all sectors, such as transportation, buildings, energy & heat production, industry, agriculture and livestock, etc. In this panel discussion, we start out with a general overview of terminology, factors, metrics, and objectives related to climate change, and then survey: (i) Green Conferences; (ii) Green Mobility; (iii) Green Cities and (iv) Green Smart Spaces. The participants are expected to bring into the discussion their own perspectives from the academic, governmental, and industrial sector to report on how they perceive the future of the Computing Field in a future shaped by Climate Change, and how we can all help achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement."
    
  biography: "Antoine Amarilli is Associate Professor in Computer Science at Télécom Paris in the DIG team.  His research topics focus on data management and theoretical computer science. He is a maintainer of the TCS4F initiative on the climate crisis and of the "No free view? No review!" manifesto on open access to scientific publications. Christophe Claramunt is a professor in computer science at the French Naval Academy. His research is oriented towards theoretical, pluri-disciplinary and practical aspects of geographical information science (GIS). His main research interests are oriented to environmental, maritime and and urban GISs. He has long contributed to the development of computing and GIS systems in developping countries and actively orientates his research on the development of green and environmental friendly computing applications. Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Cyprus. His primary research interests include Data Management in Computer Systems and Networks. He actively engages in activities to help curbing the climate crisis, including research and practice on green planning systems for self-consumption of renewable energy and development of virtual conference and tourism platforms to tackle the climate/COVID-19/energy crisis."

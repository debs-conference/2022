            <h1>Objective</h1>
            
            <p align="justify">Over the past decade, the ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS) has become the premier venue for academia and industry to discuss cutting-edge research of event-based computing related to Big Data, AI/ML, IoT, and Distributed Systems. The objectives of the 2022 ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS 2022) are to provide a forum dedicated to the dissemination of original research, the discussion of practical insights, and the reporting of experiences relevant to distributed systems and event‐based computing. The DEBS 2022 research track will highlight two focus areas connected to crucial challenges of our times: <b>climate change and sustainability</b>, and the <b>COVID-19 pandemic</b>.</p>

            <h1>Submissions</h1>
              <div style="margin-bottom: 100px;">

				<p align="justify">All research paper categories of DEBS 2022 are presented below:</p>

				<div style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 15px">
				
						<li align="justify"><b>Research papers</b>, presenting original research results on the topics of DEBS. Research papers that focus on the evaluation of existing algorithms and systems that are of interest in the DEBS community, providing new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms and systems, rather than presenting new methods. For papers that identify negative or contradictory results with respect to published results by third parties, the Program Committee may ask the third parties to comment on the submission, and potentially provide a short rebuttal/explanation to be published along with the submission. The page limit is 12 pages for regular research papers and 6 pages for short ones. Authors should state their submission type (regular/short) in the title. Notice that authors that submit a paper as regular might be offered the opportunity of having their work published as a short paper.</li>
						
						<li align="justify"><b>Vision papers</b>, outlining futuristic distributed and event-based systems. Submissions should describe novel early-stage projects with eventually high impact. Each submission should clearly state the success criteria of the futuristic system. Page limit: 6 pages.</li>
						
				</div>

				<p align="justify">DEBS 2022 places emphasis on <b>reproducibility</b>: we encourage authors of Research papers and Experiments & Benchmarks papers to make available all data used for empirical evaluation, the related software as well as clear instructions for reproducing the presented experiments, as a form of supplementary material. The reviewers will be encouraged to consider this material. This year's edition will place ACM Artifacts Available badges on papers that make their artifacts available according to ACM's rules (please see  <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current</a>).</p>

				<p align="justify">Authors of selected, top-rated papers from DEBS 2022 will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to a <b>special issue in Information Systems</b>.</p>
				
				<p align="justify">All submissions must be original, unpublished and cannot be under review for another publishing forum during the time it is under submission to DEBS.</p>
				
				<p align="justify">The conference adopts a double-blind review process for the research track, where neither authors nor reviewers know each other’s identities. <b>Supplementary material should not reveal the identity of the authors. </b> This means that papers must not list or otherwise identify the authors. References to previous work should be done in the third person so as to not reveal the identities of the authors. Research track submissions that are not anonymous may be rejected without review.</p>
				
				<p align="justify">Submissions to the research track will be evaluated by the Research Program Committee. The authors of accepted papers will be given a choice between different copyright agreements, according to the recent changes in the ACM policy. The options will include opportunities for open access as well as the traditional ACM copyright agreement.</p>

				<p align="justify">Submitted papers are required to adhere to the two-column "sigconf" ACM conference proceeding style. Templates and examples in LaTeX and various versions of Microsoft Word are available for download from the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">2017 ACM Master Article Template page</a>.</p>
				
				<p align="justify">Papers may be submitted via Microsoft CMT via the following link: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DEBS2022">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DEBS2022</a>.</p>
				
                <p align="justify">If you have any questions, please contact the PC co-chairs, Vincenzo Gulisano and Panos K. Chrysanthis at this link: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DEBS2022/Email/Chairs">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DEBS2022/Email/Chairs</a>.</p>

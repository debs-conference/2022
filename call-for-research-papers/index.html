Consequently, machine learning techniques automating the process of complex event pattern construction, operating on top of streaming as well as archival data, are highly desirable. Example topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
						<div style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 15px">
							<li>Single-pass learning over automata, trees, graphs, first-order logic formulas, and other symbolic objects;</li>
							<li>Explainable event pattern learning;</li>
							<li>Neuro-symbolic event pattern learning;</li>
							<li>Statistical relational learning for complex event processing;</li>
							<li>Distributed event pattern learning. </li>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br/>
					<div>
						<p align="justify">

            <h1>Submissions</h1>
              <div style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                
                <p align="justify">In addition to the traditional Research papers, DEBS 2021 welcomes submissions on two new categories: Experiments &amp; Benchmarks papers, and Vision papers.
								<p align="justify">All research paper categories of DEBS 2021 are presented below:</p>

                
								<div style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 15px">
										<li align="justify"><b>Research papers</b>, presenting original research results on the topics of DEBS. Page limit: <i>12 pages</i>.</li>
										<li align="justify"><b>Experiments &amp; Benchmarks papers</b>, presenting the evaluation of existing algorithms and systems that are of interest in the DEBS community. An Experiments &amp; Benchmarks paper provides new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms and systems, rather than presenting new methods. For papers that identify negative or contradictory results with respect to published results by third parties, the Program Committee may ask the third parties to comment on the submission, and potentially provide a short rebuttal/explanation to be published along with the submission. We also encourage papers presenting new ways to evaluate existing methods (e.g., novel curated datasets, benchmarking frameworks or methodologies). Page limit: <i>12 pages</i>.</li>
										<li align="justify"><b>Vision papers</b>, outlining futuristic distributed and event-based systems. Submissions should describe novel early-stage projects with eventually high impact. Each submission should clearly state the success criteria of the futuristic system. Page limit: <i>6 pages</i>.</li>
								</div>
                
								<p align="justify">DEBS 2021 places emphasis on <b>reproducibility</b>: we encourage authors of Research papers and Experiments &amp; Benchmarks papers to make available all data used for empirical evaluation, the related software as well as clear instructions for reproducing the presented experiments, as a form of supplementary material. The reviewers will be encouraged to consider this material.</p>
                
								<p align="justify">Authors of selected, top-rated papers from DEBS 2021 will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to a <b>special issue in Information Systems.</b></p> 
								<p align="justify">All submissions must be original, unpublished and cannot be under review for another publishing forum during the time it is under submission to DEBS.</p>
								<p align="justify">The conference adopts a double-blind review process for the research track, where neither authors nor reviewers know each other’s identities. <b>Supplementary material should not reveal the identity of the authors.</b> This means that papers must not list or otherwise identify the authors. References to previous work should be done in the third person as to not reveal the identities of the authors. Research track submissions that are not anonymous may be rejected without review.</p>
								
								<p align="justify">Submissions to the research track will be evaluated by the Research Program Committee. The authors of accepted papers will be given a choice between different copyright agreements, according to the recent changes in the ACM policy. The options will include opportunities for open access as well as the traditional ACM copyright agreement.</p>
                
								<p align="justify">Submitted papers are required to adhere to the two column "sigconf" ACM conference proceeding style. Templates and examples in LaTeX and various versions of Microsoft Word are available for download from <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">the 2017 ACM Master Article Template page</a>.</p>
								
								<p align="justify">Papers may be submitted via EasyChair via the following link: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=debs2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=debs2021</a></p>
								<p align="justify">In addition to the paper submission (PDF), supplementary material in the form of a URL and/or a single zip file (max 50 MB) may be optionally submitted via EasyChair.</p>
                <p align="justify">If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:debs21-research@easychair.org">contact</a> the PC co-chairs, Nesime Tatbul and Alexander Artikis.</p>

            <h1>Doctoral Symposium—Call for Papers</h1>
            
              <p align="justify">The DEBS 2022 Doctoral Symposium welcomes submissions from doctoral students who are undertaking research relevant to the DEBS 2022 conference. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:</p>

              <div>
                <li>Distributed and event-based computing within, e.g., software systems, distributed systems, distributed data processing, data management, dependability, knowledge management, networking, programming languages, security and software engineering;</li>
                <li>Domain-specific topics within event-based computing: e.g., real-time analytics, mobile computing, social networking, pervasive, green computing and ubiquitous computing, sensor networks, user interfaces, big data processing, spatio-temporal processing, cloud computing, edge computing, peer-to-peer computing, embedded systems and stream processing;</li>
                <li>Enterprise-related topics: e.g., complex event detection, enterprise application integration, real-time enterprises and web services; and</li>
                <li>Relevant research topics within the Internet of Things.</li>
              </div>
            
          </div>

          <!-- <div>
            
            <h1>Eligibility</h1>
            <p align="justify">The forum is open to all Ph.D. students. Ph.D. students at the beginning of their research journey are particularly welcome when they have a well-defined problem statement and some ideas about the solution that they want to discuss. Ph.D. students in a more advanced stage of their research should still have sufficient time remaining before completing their dissertation to be able to benefit from feedback provided from participation in the DEBS Doctoral Symposium.</p>
            
          </div> -->

          <div>
            
            <h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
            <p align="justify">Doctoral symposium papers should describe the problem addressed as part of the PhD work, explain its importance, discuss the shortcomings of existing solutions and give some indication of steps taken towards a solution. There should be enough substance to stimulate discussion at the symposium, but the work does not need to be complete. We thus encourage submissions from students both at early and late stages of their doctoral work.</p>

            <p align="justify">Submissions should be written based on the following structure, which focuses on the key methodological components required for a sound research synthesis:</p>

						<div style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 15px">
							<li><b>Problem:</b> What is the core problem you are studying during your PhD? Why is it relevant?</li>
							<li><b>Research setting:</b> What are your research questions? Which hypotheses are you going to investigate? (Noting that hypotheses must be falsifiable!) What assumptions are you taking?</li>
							<li><b>State of the art:</b> Who has worked on your problem (or a similar one) in the past? What are the main differences with regards to your research?</li>
							<li><b>Research approach:</b> What is your approach for investigating your research questions? How and why is it novel with respect to the existing state of the art? Which methodologies are you adopting?</li>
              <li><b>Evaluation plan:</b> How are you going to evaluate your research? Which datasets will you use? Are you using any established benchmarks? Have you reached any result so far?</li>
							<li><b>Conclusions and reflections:</b> What is the current status of your research? What are the main challenges you are facing? Why do you think your research will be successful?</li>
						</div>
            
            <p align="justify">Submissions must be no longer than 4 pages and must adhere to the two-column ACM conference proceeding style. Templates and examples in LaTeX and various versions of Microsoft Word are available for download from the ACM Master Article Template web pages at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>. Papers must be in PDF (Adobe’s Portable Document Format) format and must be submitted electronically.</p>
            <p align="justify">Submissions must be single-author, on the topic of the doctoral work. The name of the supervisor must be clearly marked (&ldquo;supervised by …&rdquo;) on the paper, under the author’s name.</p>

            <p align="justify">
            All accepted submissions must be presented at the symposium. Distinguished scientists will be present to give feedback and advice to the students. During the event, presentations from authors can involve media other than traditional PowerPoint-style slideshows. Online presentation will be possible when pandemic issues preclude participants travelling to DEBS.</p>
            
          </div>
					
					<div style="margin-bottom: 90px">
            <h1>Submission</h1>
						<p align="justify">
							Submit your paper using Microsoft CMT: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DEBS2022 ">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DEBS2022</a> (select "DEBS 2022 Doctoral Symposium Track"). If you have any questions, please contact the Doctoral Symposium co-chairs, Genoveva Vargas-Solar and David Eyers.
						</p>
            <p align="justify">A short summary of each accepted project will be included in the published conference proceedings, but students are free to submit their work elsewhere in parallel, also.</p>
            <p align="justify">An expert panel will judge the best submission and separately the best presentation by participating students.</p>
